# 3D-Rocket-Sim-1
A custom-built 3D rendering and physics engine written in pure Python. This project demonstrates a from-scratch implementation of the graphics pipeline (rasterization, matrix transformations) and Newtonian orbital mechanics without relying on external game engines or 3D libraries (like OpenGL or Unity).
